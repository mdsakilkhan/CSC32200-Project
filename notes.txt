	Master PyQt5 part3: Hand-coding a GUI
		- When hand-coding GUIs, define widget objects, then add them to a layout, and set the layout property of the instance of the MainWindow class to 
		the layout with all of the widgets that were just added to them.
		Example: 
			button = qtw.QPushButton('text')
			layout = qtw.QHBoxLayout()
			layout.addWidget(button)
			self.setLayout(layout)
		- Widgets cannot be added to widgets, they can only be added to layouts.
		- Layouts can be added to layouts or widgets.
	
	Master PyQt5 part 4: Introduction to Signals and Slots
		- In a GUI we create objects, e.g. buttons, lineedits, other widgets...
		- We define functionality with those widgets.
		- There is an event loop 
		- In a nutshell: Do a whole bunch of setup, get into infinite event loop until program terminates.

		- Look at signals and slots qt documentation
		- We can connect any signal to any callable--e.g. function, signal, slot, etc...
		- A signal is emitted when a particular event happens. This signal can be connected to a slot. A slot is a function that is called in response
		  to a particular signal.
